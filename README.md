# Fitness Journal
Currently this project is only able to run locally with the backend. As I look into AWS or Heroku to run the backend of my code. This project is written using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js (MERN Stack).

In order to run this project locally, you must open two terminals. CD into the frontend and backend folders.
While in the frontend folder run the command "npm run start".
In the backend folder run the command "npm run dev" (using this commands runs with nodemon) or "npm run start".
